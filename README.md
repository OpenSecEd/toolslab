toolslab
===============================================================================

This is a lab assignment I developed for a course on Computer Security during 
spring 2014.  The main aim is for the student to be allowed to explore all 
questions regarding how to practically use the theory covered in a course on 
security.

`make tools.pdf` will generate the PDF containing the instruction.
